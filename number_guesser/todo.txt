 * Some ideas to extend the proect functionalities:
 * 
 * You probably calculated the distance from the computer guess to the target and from the human guess to the target. 
 * Move this into a separate getAbsoluteDistance() function that takes two numbers and returns the distance, and then 
 * use that inside your compareGuesses() function.
 * 
 * Add functionality to check whether the user guess is between 0 and 9 and alert() the user that their number is out of range. 
 * Itâ€™s not possible to set a number outside this range with the + and = buttons, but users can do so by typing directly in the input field.
